# EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY

### PURPOSE:
The purpose of this assignment was to create an employee directory with React by breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user is able to sort the table alphabetically by first or last name, as well as search for a particular name.
