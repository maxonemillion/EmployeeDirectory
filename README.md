# EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this assignment was to create an employee directory with React by breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user is able to sort the table alphabetically by first or last name, as well as search for a particular name. 

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It is particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
